# MetalCompute
A C++ wrapper for the Apple metal-cpp library to make it easier to run compute kernels on the GPU

# Usage
It's not built yet so you can't use it


# About
I recently created a C++ application and wanted to use Apple's metal-cpp library to add gpu
proccessing capability, but I found out that it was hard to do. It eventually worked, but I don't want
to deal with that again, which is why I'm creating this. It's March 8 right now and I'm not
going to do any work until probably July, August, or September. I'm just getting this out
there right now so I can have a solid start.


## Goals
The goals for this project (which will probably change) are as follows:

- Concise and easy to read code
- A working API (duh)
- Minimal overhead
- Extensive documentation (Doxygen)
- Good, if not complete testing code coverage (doctest)
- and more!! (i cant think)

# Issues

I'm not a GitHub Repository Manager<sup>TM</sup> and don't have a solid issue format. Just state the issue, provide error messages if applicable, and do other stuff. Basically be reasonable.


### The end :)
