# MetalCompute
A C++ wrapper for the Apple metal-cpp library to make it easier to run compute kernels on the GPU

[![Dev Tests](https://github.com/sphericalcylinder/MetalCompute/actions/workflows/cmake-dev-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/sphericalcylinder/MetalCompute/actions/workflows/cmake-dev-tests.yml)


# Usage
It's a little more usable than last time. Include [MTLCompute.hpp](src/MTLCompute.hpp) for regular usage or [MTLComputeGPU.hpp](src/MTLComputeGPU.hpp) for easy usage. Everything is in the `MTLCompute::` namespace and have a look at the [examples](examples/) and the [docs](https://sphericalcylinder.github.io/MetalCompute/)
for more info. 

Building is simple, just run `cmake -S . -B build/` and then `cmake --build build/` in the top directory.


| Thing for CMake to do | Command |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Build tests | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_BUILD_TESTS=ON` |
| Install tests | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_INSTALL_TESTS=ON` |
| Build docs | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_BUILD_DOCS=ON` |
| Install docs | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_INSTALL_DOCS=ON` |
| Build examples | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` |
| Install examples | `-DMTLCOMPUTE_INSTALL_EXAMPLES=ON` |


If you enable an install flag, the build flag will be automatically enabled as well.


# This release
Whoops! It's been ~~two~~ FOUR months! School tried to murder me. The last update was so
absolutely useless that I'm surprised I did it. This update is actually more useful than the last update. Now, 
the CommandManager can take different
types of the same storage structure thing. So if you have a buffer of float2s and a 2d texture of regular floats, you can
use variadic templates on the CommandManager to have it accept both. The only drawback is that a bunch of the
functions are templated, so you have to add the <> thingies. I don't like it because it's just more to type and
it looks better without them, but that's just my opinion. I am NOT changing the GPU class to support
this. I don't know why I created that and I sure am not going to wrestle with variadic templates and fold(??) statements
again just for that stupid thing. PSA - please don't use that just use the normal code I'm begging you. The end.

Extra: I wrote this and then didn't commit anything but I've still been making changes so I really don't know
the state of the project at all. All the tests pass though so I'm sure it's fine.

# Overview
Read the docs [here](https://sphericalcylinder.github.io/MetalCompute/). I spent a lot of time
on them so I hope they're good.


### Want to do:

- [x] Command Manager different type support
- [x] Command Manager 1d and 3d texture support
- [x] Convert buffers to textures
- [x] More texture components (RGBA)

# About
I not so recently created a C++ application and wanted to use Apple's metal-cpp library to add gpu
proccessing capability, but I found out that it was hard to do. It eventually worked, but I don't want
to deal with that again, which is why I'm creating this.


## Goals
The goals for this project (which will probably change) are as follows:

- Concise and easy to read code
- A working API (duh)
- Minimal overhead
- Extensive documentation (Doxygen)
- Good, if not complete testing code coverage (doctest)
- and more!! (i cant think)
